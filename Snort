Snort - Open Source, rule based Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (NIDS/NIPS)

Three Main detection and prevention techniques in IDS and IPS
  Signature Based - relies on rules that identify the specific patterns of the known malicious behaviour
  Behviour Based - identifies new threat with new patterns that pass through signatures
  Policy Based - compares detected activities with system configuration and security policies

Snort has three main use models;
  Sniffer Mode - Read IP packets and prompt them in the console application
  Packet Logger Mode - Log all IP packets (inbound and outbound) that visit the network
  NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System) and NIPS Modes - Log/drop the packets that are deemed as malicious according to the user-defined rules

Snort can run similar to tcpdump to view various data about the packet it is ingestingsudo snort -v

You can use Snort as a sniffer and log the sniffed packets via logger mode
