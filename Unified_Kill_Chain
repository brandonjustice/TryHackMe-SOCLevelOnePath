Unified Kill Chain

Threat Modeling
  a series of steps to ultimately improve the security of a system. Basically just identifying risk
    This Includes
    1. Indetifying what systems and applications need to be secured and what function they serve in the environment
    2. Assessing what vulnerabilities and weaknesses these systems and applications may have and how they could potentially be exploited
    3. Creating a plan of action to secure these systems and applications from the vulnerabilities highlighted
    4. Putting in policies to prevent these vulnerabilities from occurring again where possible

Benefits of UKC vs other traditional kill chain frameworks:
  1. Modernity
  2. Extremely detailed (18 phases)
