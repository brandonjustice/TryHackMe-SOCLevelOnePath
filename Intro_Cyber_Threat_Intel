Intro to Cyber Threat Intel (CTI)
  Cyber Threat Intelligence - evidence-based knowledge about adversaries, including their indicators, tactics, motivations, and actionable advice against them.

  Data - Discrete indicators associated with an adversary, such as IP addresses, URLs or hashes

  Information - A combination of multiple data points that answer questions such as "How many times have employees accessed tryhackme.com withing the month?"

  Intelligence - The correlation of data and information to extract patterns of actions based on contextual analysis

  Threat Intelligence Classifications
    Strategic Intel: High-level intel that looks into the organization's threat landscape and maps out the risk areas based on trends, patterns and emerging threats that may impact business decisions
    Technical Intel: Looks into evidence and artifacts of attack used by an adversary
    Tactical Intel: Assesses adversaries' tactics, techniques and procedures
    Operational Intel: Looks into an adversary's specific motives and intent to perform an attack

CTI Lifecycle
  Six Phase Cycle
    Direction - defined goals

CTI Standards and Frameworks
  Standards and frameworks provide structures to rationalise the distribution and use of threat intel across industries.
  MITRE ATT&CK
    knowledge base of adversary behaviour
  TAXII
    The Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII) defines protocols for securely exchanging threat intel to have near real-time detection, prevention and mitigation of threats. 
  STIX
    Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) is a language developed for the "specification, capture, characterisation and communication of standardised cyber threat information"
  Cyber Kill Chain
  Diamond Model
