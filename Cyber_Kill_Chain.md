Cyber Kill Chain

Cyber Kill Chain is important for understanding how to protect against rasnomware attacks, security breaches, and APTs

  Actions on Objectives 

  Reconnaissance
    The attacker will first use OSINT to collect every available piece of information on the company and its employees
    Attackers use Email Harvesting for phishing attacks
      tools used for phishing attacks
          theHarvestoer
          Hunter.io
          OSINT Framework

Weaponization
  In this stage the attacker will weaponize their information by combining malware and exploits into a deliverable payload

Delivery
  Stage in which the attacker chooses the method for transmitting the payload or the malware.
    Examples
      Phishing email
      distributing infected USB drives in public places
      Watering Hole Attack - a targeted attack designed to aim at a specific group of people by compromising the website they are usually visiting and then redirecting them to the malicious website of attacker's choice.

Exploitation
  Stage where the attacker exploits the vulnerability
    Examples
      The victim triggers the exploit by opening the email attachment or clicking on a malicious link
      Using Zero-day exploits
      Exploit software, hardware, or even human vulnerabilities
      An attacker triggers the exploit for server-based vulnerabilities

Installation
  The attacker wants to reaccess the system if he loses connection to it. The attacker needs to install a persistent backdoor
    Examples
      Installing a web shell on the webserver
      Installing a backdoor on the victim's maching
      Creating or modifying Windows services
      Adding the entry to the "run keys" for the malicious payload in the Registry or the Startup Folder

Command and Control
  In this stage the attacker sets up a command and control channel to remotely control and manipulate the victim. Known as C2 beaconing
